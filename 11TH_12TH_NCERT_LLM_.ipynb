This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor K. Muralidhar, Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi for guiding the work of this committee. 2024-25 Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook. We are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement. Director New Delhi  National Council of Educational 20 December 2005 Research and Training (iv) 2024-25 In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise. Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following: • Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class • Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject • Difficulty level • Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning • Content, which is irrelevant in the present context This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above.

It is the story of life on earth. It is the science of life forms and living processes. Biological systems, often appear to challenge physical laws that govern the behaviour of matter and energy in our world. Historically, biological knowledge was ancillary to knowledge of human body and its function. The latter as we know, is the basis of medical practice. However, parts of biological knowledge developed independent of human application. Fundamental questions about origin of life, the origin and growth of biodiversity, the evolution of flora and fauna of different habitats, etc., caught the imagination of biologists. The very description of living organisms, be it from morphological perspective, physiological perspective, taxonomical perspective, etc., engaged scientists to such an extent that for sheer convenience, if not for anything else, the subject matter got artificially divided into the sub- disciplines of botany and zoology and later into even microbiology. Meanwhile, physical sciences made heavy inroads into biology, and established biochemistry and biophysics as new sub- disciplines of biology. Mendel’s work and its rediscovery in the early twentieth century led to the promotion of study of genetics. The discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA and the deciphering of three dimensional structures of many macromolecules led to the establishment of and phenomenal growth in the dominating area of molecular biology. In a sense, functional disciplines laying emphasis on mechanisms underlying living processes, received more attention, support, intellectual and social recognition. Biology,  unfortunately, got divided into classical and modern biology. To the majority of practising biologists, pursuit of biological research became more empirical rather than a curiosity and hypothesis driven intellectual exercise as is the case with theoretical physics, experimental physics, structural chemistry and material science. Fortunately and quietly, general unifying principles of biology were also being discovered, rediscovered and emphasised. The work of Mayr, Dobhzhansky, Haldane, Perutz, Khorana, Morgan, Darlington, Fisher and many others brought respect and seriousness to both classical and molecular biological disciplines. Ecology and Systems biology got established as unifying biological disciplines. Every area of biology began developing interface with not only other areas of biology but also other disciplines of science and mathematics. Pretty soon, the boundaries became porous. They are now on the verge of disappearing altogether. Progress in human biology, biomedical sciences, especially the structure, functioning and evolution of human brain brought in respect, awe and philosophical insights to biology. Biology even stepped out of laboratories, museums and natural parks and raised social, economic and cultural issues capturing the imagination of general public and hence political attention. Educationists did not lag behind and realised that biology should be taught as an interdisciplinary and integrating science at all stages of educational training especially at school and undergraduate levels. A new synthesis of all areas of basic and applied areas of biology is the need of the hour. Biology has come of age. It has an independent set of concepts which are universal just like physics and chemistry and mathematics. The present volume is the first time presentation of the integrated biology for the school level children. One of the lacunae in biology teaching and study is the absence of integration 2024-25 with other disciplinary knowledge of physics, chemistry etc. Further many processes in plants, animals and microbes are similar when looked from physico-chemical perspective. Cell biology has brought out the unifying common cellular level activities underlying apparently diverse phenomena across plants, animals and microbes. Similarly, molecular science (e.g. biochemistry or molecular biology) has revealed the similar molecular mechanisms in all these apparently diverse organisms like plants, animals and microbes. Phenomena like respiration, metabolism, energy utlisation, growth, reproduction and development can be discussed in a unifying manner rather than as separate unrelated processes in plants and animals. An attempt has been made to unify such diverse disciplines in the book. The integration achieved however, is partial and not complete. Hopefully along with changes in the teaching and learning context, to be brought out in the next few years, the next edition of this book will reveal more integration of botany, zoology and microbiology and truly reflect the true nature of biology – the future science of man by man and for man. This new textbook of Biology for class XI is a completely rewritten book in view of the syllabus revision and restructuring. It is also in accordance with the spirit of the National Curriculum Framework (2005) guidelines. The subject matter is presented under twenty-two chapters which are grouped under five thematic units. Each unit has a brief write up preceding the unit highlighting the essence of the chapters to follow under that unit. Each unit also has a biographical sketch of a prominent scientist in that area. Each chapter has, on the first page, a detailed table of contents giving sub-headings within the chapter. Decimal system using arabic numerals has been employed to indicate these sub-headings. At the end of each chapter a brief summary is provided. This brings to the notice of the student, what she/he is supposed to have learnt by studying the chapter. A set of questions is also provided at the conclusion of each chapter. These questions are essentially to enable the student to test herself/himself as to how much she/he has understood the subject matter. There are questions which are purely of information recall type; there are questions which need analytical thinking to answer and hence test true understanding; there are questions which are problems to solve and finally there are questions which need analysis and speculation as there is no one to answer to such questions. This tests the critical understanding of the subject matter in the mind of the student. Special emphasis has been given on the narrative style, illustrations, activity exercises, clarity of expression, coverage of topics within the available time in school. A large number of extremely talented and dedicated people including practising teachers helped in bringing out this beautiful book. Our main purpose was to make sure that school level biology is not a burden for students and teachers. We sincerely wish that teaching biology and learning biology would become an enjoyable activity.

The living world comprises an amazing diversity of living organisms. Early man could easily perceive the difference between inanimate matter and living organisms. Early man deified some of the inanimate matter (wind, sea, fire etc.) and some among the animals and plants. A common feature of all such forms of inanimate and animate objects was the sense of awe or fear that they evoked. The description of living organisms including human beings began much later in human history. Societies which indulged in anthropocentric view of biology could register limited progress in biological knowledge. Systematic and monumental description of life forms brought in, out of necessity, detailed systems of identification, nomenclature and classification. The biggest spin off of such studies was the recognition of the sharing of similarities among living organisms both horizontally and vertically. That all present day living organisms are related to each other and also to all organisms that ever lived on this earth, was a revelation which humbled man and led to cultural movements for conservation of biodiversity. In the following chapters of this unit, you will get a description, including classification, of animals and plants from a taxonomist’s perspective. DIVERSITY IN THE LIVING WORLD Chapter 1 The Living World Chapter 2 Biological Classification Chapter 3 Plant Kingdom Chapter 4 Animal Kingdom UNIT 1 2024-25 Born on 5 July 1904, in Kempten, Germany, ERNST MAYR, the Harvard University evolutionary biologist who has been called ‘The Darwin of the 20th century’, was one of the 100 greatest scientists of all time. Mayr joined Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 1953 and retired in 1975, assuming the title Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology Emeritus. Throughout his nearly 80-year career, his research spanned ornithology, taxonomy, zoogeography, evolution, systematics, and the history and philosophy of biology. He almost single-handedly made the origin of species diversity the central question of evolutionary biology that it is today. He also pioneered the currently accepted definition of a biological species. Mayr was awarded the three prizes widely regarded as the triple crown of biology: the Balzan Prize in 1983, the International Prize for Biology in 1994, and the Crafoord Prize in 1999. Mayr died at the age of 100 in the year 2004. Ernst Mayr (1904 – 2004) 2024-25 How wonderful is the living world ! The wide range of living types is amazing. The extraordinary habitats in which we find living organisms, be it cold mountains, deciduous forests, oceans, fresh water lakes, deserts or hot springs, leave us speechless. The beauty of a galloping horse, of the migrating birds, the valley of flowers or the attacking shark evokes awe and a deep sense of wonder. The ecological conflict and cooperation among members of a population and among populations of a community or even the molecular traffic inside a cell make us deeply reflect on – what indeed is life? This question has two implicit questions within it. The first is a technical one and seeks answer to what living is as opposed to the non-living, and the second is a philosophical one, and seeks answer to what the purpose of life is. As scientists, we shall not attempt answering the second question. We will try to reflect on – what is living? 1.1 DIVERSITY IN THE LIVING WORLD If you look around you will see a large variety of living organisms, be it potted plants, insects, birds, your pets or other animals and plants. There are also several organisms that you cannot see with your naked eye but they are all around you. If you were to increase the area that you make observations in, the range and variety of organisms that you see would increase. Obviously, if you were to visit a dense forest, you would probably see a much greater number and kinds of living organisms in it. Each different kind of plant, animal or organism that you see, represents a species. The number of species that are known and described range between 1.7-1.8 million. This refers to biodiversity or the number and THE LIVING WORLD CHAPTER  1 1.1 Diversity in the Living World 1.2 Taxonomic Categories 2024-25 4 BIOLOGY types of organisms present on earth. We should remember here that as we explore new areas, and even old ones, new organisms are continuously being identified. As stated earlier, there are millions of plants and animals in the world; we know the plants and animals in our own area by their local names. These local names would vary from place to place, even within a country. Probably you would recognise the confusion that would be created if we did not find ways and means to talk to each other, to refer to organisms we are talking about. Hence, there is a need to standardise the naming of living organisms such that a particular organism is known by the same name all over the world. This process is called nomenclature. Obviously, nomenclature or naming is only possible when the organism is described correctly and we know to what organism the name is attached to. This is identification. In order to facilitate the study, number of scientists have established procedures to assign a scientific name to each known organism. This is acceptable to biologists all over the world. For plants, scientific names are based on agreed principles and criteria, which are provided in International Code for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). You may ask, how  are animals named? Animal taxonomists have evolved International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). The scientific names ensure that each organism has only one name. Description of any organism should enable the people (in any part of the world) to arrive at the same name. They also ensure that such a name has not been used for any other known organism. Biologists follow universally accepted principles to provide scientific names to known organisms. Each name has two components – the Generic name and the specific epithet. This system of providing a name with two components is called Binomial nomenclature. This naming system given by Carolus Linnaeus is being practised by biologists all over the world. This naming system using a two word format was found convenient. Let us take the example of mango to understand the way of providing scientific names better. The scientific name of mango is written as Mangifera indica. Let us see how it is a binomial name. In this name Mangifera represents the genus while indica, is a particular species, or a specific epithet. Other universal rules of nomenclature are as follows: 1. Biological names are generally in Latin and written in italics. They are Latinised or derived from Latin irrespective of their origin. 2. The first word in a biological name represents the genus while the second component denotes the specific epithet. 3. Both the words in a biological name, when handwritten, are separately underlined, or printed in italics to indicate their Latin origin. 2024-25 THE LIVING WORLD 5 4. The first word denoting the genus starts with a capital letter while the specific epithet starts with a small letter. It can be illustrated with the example of Mangifera indica. Name of the author appears after the specific epithet, i.e., at the end of the biological name and is written in an abbreviated form, e.g., Mangifera indica Linn. It indicates that this species was first described by Linnaeus. Since it is nearly impossible to study all the living organisms, it is necessary to devise some means to make this possible. This process is classification. Classification is the process by which anything is grouped into convenient categories based on some easily observable characters. For example, we easily recognise groups such as plants or animals or dogs, cats or insects. The moment we use any of these terms, we associate certain characters with the organism in that group. What image do you see when you think of a dog ?'}\n",
            "{'chunk_token_count': 5349.0, 'sentence': \"Obviously, each one of us will see ‘dogs’ and not ‘cats’. Now, if we were to think of ‘Alsatians’ we know what we are talking about. Similarly, suppose we were to say ‘mammals’, you would, of course, think of animals with external ears and body hair. Likewise, in plants, if we try to talk of ‘Wheat’, the picture in each of our minds will be of wheat plants, not of rice or any other plant. Hence, all these - ‘Dogs’, ‘Cats’, ‘Mammals’, ‘Wheat’, ‘Rice’, ‘Plants’, ‘Animals’, etc., are convenient categories we use to study organisms. The scientific term for these categories is taxa. Here you must recognise that taxa can indicate categories at very different levels. ‘Plants’ – also form a taxa. ‘Wheat’ is also a taxa. Similarly, ‘animals’, ‘mammals’, ‘dogs’ are all taxa – but you know that a dog is a mammal and mammals are animals. Therefore, ‘animals’, ‘mammals’ and ‘dogs’ represent taxa at different levels. Hence, based on characteristics, all living organisms can be classified into different taxa. This process of classification is taxonomy. External and internal structure, along with the structure of cell, development process and ecological information of organisms are essential and form the basis of modern taxonomic studies. Hence, characterisation, identification, classification and nomenclature are the processes that are basic to taxonomy. Taxonomy is not something new. Human beings have always been interested in knowing more and more about the various kinds of organisms, particularly with reference to their own use. In early days, human beings needed to find sources for their basic needs of food, clothing and shelter. Hence, the earliest classifications were based on the ‘uses’ of various organisms. Human beings were, since long, not only interested in knowing more about different kinds of organisms and their diversities, but also the relationships among them. This branch of study was referred to as systematics. The word systematics is derived from the Latin word ‘systema’ which means systematic arrangement of organisms. Linnaeus 2024-25 6 BIOLOGY used Systema Naturae as the  title of his publication. The scope of systematics was later enlarged to include identification, nomenclature and classification. Systematics takes into account evolutionary relationships between organisms. 1.2 TAXONOMIC CATEGORIES Classification is not a single step process but involves hierarchy of steps in which each step represents a rank or category. Since the category is a part of overall taxonomic arrangement, it is called the taxonomic category and all categories together constitute the taxonomic hierarchy. Each category, referred to as a unit of classification, in fact, represents a rank and is commonly termed as taxon (pl. : taxa). Taxonomic categories and hierarchy can be illustrated by an example. Insects represent a group of organisms sharing common features like three pairs of jointed legs. It means insects are recognisable concrete objects which can be classified, and thus were given a rank or category. Can you name other such groups of organisms? Remember, groups represent category. Category further denotes rank. Each rank or taxon, in fact, represents a unit of classification. These taxonomic groups/ categories are distinct biological entities and not merely morphological aggregates. Taxonomical studies of all known organisms have led to the development of common categories such as kingdom, phylum or division (for plants), class, order, family, genus and species. All organisms, including those in the plant and animal kingdoms have species as the lowest category. Now the question you may ask is, how to place an organism in various categories? The basic requirement is the knowledge of characters of an individual or group of organisms. This helps in identifying similarities and dissimilarities among the individuals of the same kind of organisms as well as of other kinds of organisms. 1.2.1 Species Taxonomic studies consider a group of individual organisms with fundamental similarities as a species. One should be able to distinguish one species from the other closely related species based on the distinct morphological differences. Let us consider Mangifera indica, Solanum tuberosum (potato) and Panthera leo (lion). All the three names, indica, tuberosum and leo, represent the specific epithets,  while the first words Mangifera, Solanum and Panthera are genera and represents another higher level of taxon or category. Each genus may have one or more than one specific epithets representing different organisms, but having morphological similarities. For example,  Panthera has another specific epithet called tigris and Solanum includes species like nigrum and 2024-25 THE LIVING WORLD 7 melongena. Human beings belong to the species sapiens  which is grouped in the genus Homo. The scientific name thus, for human being, is written as Homo sapiens. 1.2.2 Genus Genus comprises a group of related species which has more characters in common in comparison to species of other genera. We can say that genera are aggregates of closely related species. For example, potato and brinjal are two different species but both belong to the genus Solanum. Lion (Panthera leo), leopard (P. pardus) and tiger (P. tigris) with several common features, are all species of the genus Panthera. This genus differs from another genus Felis which includes cats. 1.2.3 Family The next category, Family, has a group of related genera with still less number of similarities as compared to genus and species. Families are characterised on the basis of both vegetative and reproductive features of plant species. Among plants for example, three different genera Solanum, Petunia and Datura are placed in the family Solanaceae. Among animals for example, genus Panthera, comprising lion, tiger, leopard is put along with genus, Felis (cats) in the family Felidae. Similarly, if you observe the features of a cat and a dog, you will find some similarities and  some differences as well. They are separated into two different families – Felidae and Canidae, respectively. 1.2.4 Order You have seen earlier that categories like species, genus and families are based on a number of similar characters. Generally, order and other higher taxonomic categories are identified based on the aggregates of characters. Order being a higher category, is the assemblage of families which exhibit a few similar characters. The similar characters are less in number as compared to different genera included in a family. Plant families like Convolvulaceae, Solanaceae are included in the order Polymoniales mainly based on the floral characters. The animal order, Carnivora, includes families like Felidae and Canidae. 1.2.5 Class This category includes related orders. For example, order Primata comprising monkey, gorilla and gibbon is placed in class Mammalia along with order Carnivora that includes animals like tiger, cat and dog. Class Mammalia has other orders also. 1.2.6 Phylum Classes comprising animals like fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds along with mammals constitute the next higher category called Phylum. All 2024-25 8 BIOLOGY these, based on the common features like presence of notochord and dorsal hollow neural system, are included in phylum Chordata. In case of plants,  classes with a few similar characters are assigned to a higher category called Division. 1.2.7 Kingdom All animals belonging to various phyla are assigned to the highest category called Kingdom Animalia in the classification system of animals. The Kingdom Plantae, on the other hand, is distinct, and comprises all plants from various divisions. Henceforth, we will refer to these two groups as animal and plant kingdoms. The taxonomic categories from species to kingdom have been shown in ascending order starting with species in Figure 1.1. These are broad categories. However, taxonomists have also developed sub-categories in this hierarchy to facilitate more sound and scientific placement of various taxa. Look at the hierarchy in Figure 1.1. Can you recall the basis of arrangement? Say, for example, as we go higher from species to kingdom, the number of common characteristics goes on decreasing. Lower the taxa, more are the characteristics that the members within the taxon share. Higher the category, greater is the difficulty of determining the relationship to other taxa at the same level. Hence, the problem of classification becomes more complex. Table 1.1 indicates the taxonomic categories to which some common organisms like housefly, man, mango and wheat belong. Figure 1.1 Taxonomic c a t e g o r i e s s h o w i n g hierarchial arrangement in ascending order Common Biological Genus Family Order Class Phylum/ Name  Name Division Man Homo sapiens Homo Hominidae Primata Mammalia Chordata Housefly Musca Musca Muscidae Diptera Insecta Arthropoda domestica Mango Mangifera Mangifera Anacardiaceae Sapindales Dicotyledonae Angiospermae indica Wheat Triticum Triticum Poaceae Poales Monocotyledonae Angiospermae aestivum TABLE 1.1  Organisms with their Taxonomic Categories 2024-25 THE LIVING WORLD 9 SUMMARY The living world is rich in variety. Millions of plants and animals have been identified and described but a large number still remains unknown. The very range of organisms in terms of size, colour, habitat, physiological and morphological features make us seek the defining characteristics of living organisms. In order to facilitate the study of kinds and diversity of organisms, biologists have evolved certain rules and principles for identification, nomenclature and classification of organisms. The branch of knowledge dealing with these aspects is referred to as taxonomy. The taxonomic studies of various species of plants and animals are useful in agriculture, forestry, industry and in general for knowing our bio-resources and their diversity. The basics of taxonomy like identification, naming and classification of organisms are universally evolved under international codes. Based on the resemblances and distinct differences, each organism is identified and assigned a correct scientific/biological name comprising two words as per the binomial system of nomenclature. An organism represents/occupies a place or position in the system of classification. There are many categories/ ranks and are generally referred to as taxonomic categories or taxa. All the categories constitute a taxonomic hierarchy. EXERCISES 1. Why are living organisms classified? 2. Why are the classification systems changing every now and then? 3.

Illustrate the taxonomical hierarchy with suitable examples of a plant and an animal. 2024-25 10 BIOLOGY Since the dawn of civilisation, there have been many attempts to classify living organisms. It was done instinctively not using criteria that were scientific but borne out of a need to use organisms for our own use – for food, shelter and clothing. Aristotle was the earliest to attempt a more scientific basis for classification. He used simple morphological characters to classify plants into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animals into two groups, those which had red blood and those that did not. In Linnaeus' time a Two Kingdom system of classification with Plantae  and Animalia kingdoms was developed that included all plants and animals respectively. This system did not distinguish between the eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms and photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi) organisms. Classification of organisms into plants and animals was easily done and was easy to understand, but, a large number of organisms did not fall into either category. Hence the two kingdom classification used for a long time was found inadequate. Besides, gross morphology a need was also felt for including other characteristics like cell structure, nature of wall, mode of nutrition, habitat, methods of reproduction, evolutionary relationships, etc. Classification systems for the living organisms have hence, undergone several changes over the time. Though plant and animal kingdoms have been a constant under all different systems, the understanding of what groups/organisms be included under these kingdoms have been changing; the number and nature of other kingdoms have also been understood differently by different scientists over the time. BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION CHAPTER  2 2.1 Kingdom Monera 2.2 Kingdom Protista 2.3 Kingdom Fungi 2.4 Kingdom Plantae 2.5 Kingdom Animalia 2.6 Viruses, Viroids and Lichens 2024-25 BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 11 R.H. Whittaker (1969) proposed a Five Kingdom Classification. The kingdoms defined by him were named Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia. The main criteria for classification used by him include cell structure, body organisation, mode of nutrition, reproduction and phylogenetic relationships. Table 2.1 gives a comparative account of different characteristics of the five kingdoms. The three-domain system has also been proposed that divides the Kingdom Monera into two domains, leaving the remaining eukaryotic kingdoms in the third domain and thereby a six kingdom classification. You will learn about this system in detail at higher classes. Let us look at this five kingdom classification to understand the issues and considerations that influenced the classification system. Earlier classification systems included bacteria, blue green algae, fungi, mosses, ferns, gymnosperms and the angiosperms under ‘Plants’. The character that unified this whole kingdom was that all the organisms included had a cell wall in their cells. This placed together groups which widely differed in other characteristics. It brought together the prokaryotic bacteria and the blue green algae (  cyanobacteria) with other groups which were eukaryotic. It also grouped together the unicellular organisms and the multicellular ones, say, for example, Chlamydomonas and Spirogyra were placed together under algae. The classification did not differentiate between the heterotrophic group – fungi, and the autotrophic green plants, though they also showed a characteristic difference in their walls composition – the fungi had chitin Five Kingdoms Characters Cell type Cell wall Nuclear membrane Body organisation Mode of nutrition Monera Prokaryotic Noncellulosic (Polysaccharide + amino acid) Absent Cellular Autotrophic (chemosyn- thetic and photosynthetic) and Hetero- trophic (sapro- phytic/para- sitic) Protista Eukaryotic Present in some Present Cellular Autotrophic (Photosyn- thetic) and Hetero- trophic Fungi Eukaryotic Present with chitin Present Multiceullar/ loose tissue Heterotrophic (Saprophytic/ Parasitic) Plantae Eukaryotic Present (cellulose) Present Tissue/ organ Autotrophic (Photosyn- thetic) Animalia Eukaryotic Absent Present Tissue/organ/ organ system Heterotrophic ( H o l o z o i c / S a p r o p h y t i c etc.) TABLE 2.1  Characteristics of the Five Kingdoms 2024-25 12 BIOLOGY in their walls while the green plants had a cellulosic cell wall. When such characteristics were considered, the fungi were placed in a separate kingdom – Kingdom Fungi. All prokaryotic organisms were grouped together under Kingdom Monera and the unicellular eukaryotic organisms were placed in Kingdom Protista. Kingdom Protista has brought together Chlamydomonas, Chlorella (earlier placed in Algae within Plants and both having cell walls) with Paramoecium and Amoeba (which were earlier placed in the animal kingdom which lack cell wall). It has put together organisms which, in earlier classifications, were placed in different kingdoms. This happened because the criteria for classification changed. This kind of changes will take place in future too depending on the improvement in our understanding of characteristics and evolutionary relationships. Over time, an attempt has been made to evolve a classification system which reflects not only the morphological, physiological and reproductive similarities, but is also phylogenetic, i.e., is based on  evolutionary relationships. In this chapter we will study characteristics of Kingdoms Monera, Protista and Fungi of the Whittaker system of classification. The Kingdoms Plantae and Animalia, commonly referred to as plant and animal kingdoms, respectively, will be dealt separately in chapters 3 and 4. Spore Flagellum Cocci Bacilli Spirilla Vibrio Figure 2.1 Bacteria of different shapes 2.1 KINGDOM MONERA Bacteria are the sole members of the Kingdom Monera. They are the most abundant micro-organisms. Bacteria occur almost everywhere. Hundreds of bacteria are present in a handful of soil. They also live in extreme habitats such as hot springs, deserts, snow and deep oceans where very few other life forms can survive. Many of them live in or on other organisms as parasites. Bacteria are grouped under four categories based on their shape: the spherical Coccus (pl. : cocci), the rod-shaped Bacillus (pl. : bacilli), the comma-shaped Vibrium (pl. : vibrio) and the spiral Spirillum (pl. : spirilla) (Figure 2.1). 2024-25 BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 13 Though the bacterial structure is very simple, they are very complex in behaviour. Compared to many other organisms, bacteria as a group show the most extensive metabolic diversity. Some of the bacteria are autotrophic, i.e., they synthesise their own food from inorganic substrates. They may be photosynthetic autotrophic or chemosynthetic autotrophic. The vast majority of bacteria are heterotrophs, i.e., they depend on other organisms or on dead organic matter for food. 2.1.1 Archaebacteria These bacteria are special since they live in some of the most harsh habitats such as extreme salty areas (halophiles), hot springs (thermoacidophiles) and marshy areas (methanogens). Archaebacteria differ from other bacteria in having a different cell wall structure and this feature is responsible for their survival in extreme conditions. Methanogens are present in the gut of several ruminant animals such as cows and buffaloes and they are responsible for the production of methane (biogas) from the dung of these animals. Figure 2.2 A filamentous blue-green algae – Nostoc 2.1.2 Eubacteria There are thousands of different eubacteria  or ‘true bacteria’. They are characterised by the presence of a rigid cell wall, and if motile, a flagellum. The cyanobacteria (also referred to as blue-green algae) have chlorophyll a similar to green plants and are photosynthetic autotrophs (Figure 2.2). The cyanobacteria  are  unicellular,  colonial  or  filamentous, freshwater/marine or terrestrial algae. The colonies are generally surrounded by gelatinous sheath. They often form blooms in polluted water bodies. Some of these organisms can fix atmospheric nitrogen in specialised cells called  heterocysts, e.g., Nostoc and Anabaena. Chemosynthetic  autotrophic bacteria oxidise various inorganic substances such as nitrates, nitrites and ammonia and use the released energy for their ATP production. They play a great role in recycling nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous, iron and sulphur. Heterotrophic bacteria are most abundant in nature. The majority are important decomposers. Many of them have a significant impact on human affairs. They are helpful in making curd from milk, production  of antibiotics, fixing nitrogen in legume 2024-25 14 BIOLOGY roots, etc. Some are pathogens causing damage to human beings, crops, farm animals and pets. Cholera, typhoid, tetanus, citrus canker are well known diseases  caused by different bacteria. Bacteria reproduce mainly by fission (Figure 2.3). Sometimes, under unfavourable conditions, they produce spores. They also reproduce by a sort of sexual reproduction by adopting a primitive type of DNA transfer from one bacterium to the other. The Mycoplasma are organisms that completely lack a cell wall. They are the smallest living cells known and can survive without oxygen. Many mycoplasma are pathogenic in animals and plants. 2.2 KINGDOM PROTISTA All single-celled eukaryotes are placed under Protista, but the boundaries of this kingdom are not well defined. What may be ‘a photosynthetic protistan’ to one biologist may be ‘a plant’ to another. In this book we include Chrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime moulds and Protozoans under Protista. Members of Protista are primarily aquatic. This kingdom forms a link with the others dealing with plants, animals and fungi. Being eukaryotes, the protistan cell body contains a well defined nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.\"}\n",
            "{'chunk_token_count': 4413.75, 'sentence': 'Some have flagella or cilia. Protists reproduce asexually and sexually by a process involving cell fusion and zygote formation. 2.2.1 Chrysophytes This group includes diatoms and golden algae (desmids). They are found in fresh water as well as in marine environments. They are microscopic and float passively in water currents (plankton). Most of them are photosynthetic. In diatoms the cell walls form two thin overlapping shells, which fit together as in a soap box. The walls are embedded with silica and thus the walls are indestructible. Thus, diatoms have left behind large amount of cell wall deposits in their habitat; this accumulation over billions of years is referred to as ‘diatomaceous earth’. Being gritty this soil is used in polishing, filtration of oils and syrups. Diatoms are the chief ‘producers’ in the oceans. Figure 2.3 A dividing bacterium 2024-25 BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 15 2.2.2 Dinoflagellates These organisms are mostly marine and photosynthetic. They appear yellow, green, brown, blue or red depending on the main pigments present in their cells. The cell wall has stiff cellulose plates on the outer surface. Most of them have two flagella; one lies longitudinally and the other transversely in a furrow between the wall plates. Very often, red dinoflagellates (Example: Gonyaulax) undergo such rapid multiplication that they make the sea appear red (red tides). Toxins released by such large numbers may even kill other marine animals such as fishes. 2.2.3 Euglenoids Majority of them are fresh water organisms found in stagnant water. Instead of a cell wall, they have a protein rich layer called pellicle which makes their body flexible. They have two flagella, a short and a long one. Though they are photosynthetic in the presence of sunlight, when deprived of sunlight they behave like heterotrophs by predating on other smaller organisms. Interestingly, the pigments of euglenoids are identical to those present in higher plants. Example: Euglena (Figure 2.4b). 2.2.4 Slime Moulds Slime moulds are saprophytic protists. The body moves along decaying twigs and leaves engulfing organic material. Under suitable conditions, they form an aggregation called plasmodium which may grow and spread over several feet. During unfavourable conditions, the plasmodium differentiates and forms fruiting bodies bearing spores at their tips. The spores possess true walls. They are extremely resistant and survive for many years, even under adverse conditions. The spores are dispersed by air currents. 2.2.5 Protozoans All protozoans are heterotrophs and live as predators or parasites. They are believed to be primitive relatives of animals. There are four major groups of protozoans. Amoeboid protozoans: These organisms live in fresh water, sea water or moist soil. They move and capture Figure 2.4 (a) Dinoflagellates (b) Euglena (c) Slime mould (d) Paramoecium (d) (a) (c) (b) 2024-25 16 BIOLOGY their prey by putting out pseudopodia (false feet) as in Amoeba. Marine forms have silica shells on their surface. Some of them such as Entamoeba are parasites. Flagellated protozoans: The members of this group are either free-living or parasitic. They have flagella. The parasitic forms cause diaseases such as sleeping sickness. Example: Trypanosoma. Ciliated protozoans: These are aquatic, actively moving organisms because of the presence of thousands of cilia. They have a cavity (gullet) that opens to the outside of the cell surface. The coordinated movement of rows of cilia causes the water laden with food to be steered into the gullet. Example: Paramoecium (Figure 2.4d). Sporozoans: This includes diverse organisms that have an infectious spore-like stage in their life cycle. The most notorious is Plasmodium (malarial parasite) which causes malaria, a disease which has a staggering effect on human population. 2.3 KINGDOM FUNGI The fungi constitute a unique kingdom of heterotrophic organisms. They show a great diversity in morphology and habitat. You  must have seen fungi on a moist bread and rotten fruits. The common mushroom you eat and toadstools are also fungi. White spots seen on mustard leaves are due to a parasitic fungus. Some unicellular fungi, e.g., yeast are used to make bread and beer. Other fungi cause diseases in plants and animals; wheat rust-causing Puccinia is an important example. Some are the source of antibiotics, e.g., Penicillium. Fungi are cosmopolitan and occur in air, water, soil and on animals and plants. They prefer to grow in warm and humid places. Have you ever wondered why we keep food in the refrigerator ? Yes, it is to prevent food from going bad due to bacterial or fungal infections. With the exception of yeasts which are unicellular, fungi are filamentous. Their bodies consist of long, slender thread-like structures called hyphae. The network of hyphae is known as mycelium. Some hyphae are continuous tubes filled with multinucleated cytoplasm – these are called coenocytic hyphae. Others have septae or cross walls in their hyphae. The cell walls of fungi are composed of chitin and polysaccharides. Most fungi are heterotrophic and absorb soluble organic matter from dead substrates and hence are  called saprophytes. Those that depend on living plants and animals are called parasites. They can also live as symbionts – in association with algae as lichens and with roots of higher plants as mycorrhiza. Reproduction in fungi can take place by vegetative means – fragmentation, fission and budding. Asexual reproduction is by spores 2024-25 BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 17 called conidia or sporangiospores or zoospores, and sexual reproduction is by oospores, ascospores and basidiospores. The various spores are produced in distinct structures called fruiting bodies. The sexual cycle involves the following  three steps: (i) Fusion of protoplasms between two motile or non-motile gametes called plasmogamy. (ii) Fusion of two nuclei called karyogamy. (iii) Meiosis in zygote resulting in haploid spores. When a fungus reproduces sexually, two haploid hyphae of compatible mating types come together and fuse. In some fungi the fusion of two haploid cells immediately results in diploid cells (2n). However, in other fungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes), an intervening dikaryotic stage (n + n, i.e., two nuclei per cell) occurs; such a condition is called a dikaryon and the phase is called dikaryophase of fungus. Later, the parental nuclei fuse and the cells become diploid. The fungi form fruiting bodies in which reduction division occurs, leading to formation of haploid spores. The morphology of the mycelium, mode of spore formation and fruiting bodies  form the basis for the division of the kingdom  into various classes. 2.3.1 Phycomycetes Members of phycomycetes are found in aquatic habitats and on decaying wood in moist and damp places or as obligate parasites on plants. The mycelium is aseptate and coenocytic. Asexual reproduction takes place by zoospores (motile) or by aplanospores (non-motile). These spores are endogenously produced in sporangium. A zygospore is formed by fusion of two gametes. These gametes are similar in morphology (isogamous) or dissimilar (anisogamous or oogamous). Some common examples are Mucor (Figure 2.5a), Rhizopus (the bread mould mentioned earlier) and Albugo (the parasitic fungi on mustard). 2.3.2 Ascomycetes Commonly known as sac-fungi, the ascomycetes  are mostly multicellular, e.g., Penicillium, or rarely unicellular, e.g., yeast (Saccharomyces). They are saprophytic, decomposers, parasitic or coprophilous (growing on dung). Mycelium Figure 2.5 Fungi: (a) Mucor (b) Aspergillus (c) Agaricus (c) (a) (b) 2024-25 18 BIOLOGY is branched and septate. The asexual spores are conidia produced exogenously on the special mycelium called conidiophores. Conidia on germination produce mycelium. Sexual spores are called ascospores which are produced endogenously in sac like asci (singular ascus). These asci are arranged in different types of fruiting bodies called ascocarps. Some examples are Aspergillus (Figure 2.5b), Claviceps and Neurospora. Neurospora  is used extensively in biochemical and genetic work. Many members like morels and truffles are edible and are considered  delicacies. 2.3.3 Basidiomycetes Commonly known forms of basidiomycetes are mushrooms, bracket fungi or puffballs. They grow in soil, on logs and tree stumps and in living plant bodies as parasites, e.g., rusts and smuts. The mycelium is branched and septate. The asexual spores are generally not found, but vegetative reproduction by fragmentation is common. The sex organs are absent, but plasmogamy is brought about by fusion of two vegetative or somatic cells of different strains or genotypes. The resultant structure is dikaryotic which ultimately gives rise to basidium. Karyogamy and meiosis take place in the basidium producing four basidiospores. The basidiospores are exogenously produced on the basidium (pl. : basidia). The basidia are arranged in fruiting bodies called basidiocarps. Some common members are Agaricus (mushroom) (Figure 2.5c), Ustilago (smut) and Puccinia (rust fungus). 2.3.4 Deuteromycetes Commonly known as imperfect fungi because only the asexual or vegetative phases of these fungi are known. When the sexual forms of these fungi were discovered they were moved into classes they rightly belong to. It is also possible that the asexual and vegetative stage have been given one name (and placed under deuteromycetes) and the sexual stage another (and placed under another class). Later when the linkages were established, the fungi were correctly identified and moved out of deuteromycetes. Once perfect (sexual) stages of members of dueteromycetes were discovered they were often moved to ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. The deuteromycetes reproduce only by asexual spores known as conidia. The mycelium is septate and branched. Some members are saprophytes or parasites while a large number of them are decomposers of litter and help in mineral cycling. Some examples are Alternaria, Colletotrichum and Trichoderma. 2024-25 BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 19 2.4 KINGDOM PLANTAE Kingdom Plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing organisms commonly called plants. A few members are partially heterotrophic such as the insectivorous plants or parasites. Bladderwort and Venus fly trap are examples of insectivorous plants and Cuscuta is a parasite. The plant cells have an eukaryotic structure with prominent chloroplasts and cell wall mainly made of cellulose. You will study the eukaryotic cell structure in detail in Chapter 8. Plantae includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms. Life cycle of plants has two distinct phases – the diploid sporophytic and the haploid gametophytic – that alternate with each other. The lengths of the haploid and diploid phases, and whether these phases are free– living or dependent on others, vary among different groups in plants. This phenomenon is called alternation of generation. You will study further details of this kingdom in Chapter 3. 2.5 KINGDOM ANIMALIA This kingdom is characterised by heterotrophic eukaryotic organisms that are multicellular and their cells lack cell walls. They directly or indirectly depend on plants for food. They digest their food in an internal cavity and store food reserves as glycogen or fat. Their mode of nutrition is holozoic – by ingestion of food. They follow a definite growth pattern and grow into adults that have a definite shape and size. Higher forms show elaborate sensory and neuromotor mechanism. Most of them are capable of locomotion. The sexual reproduction is by copulation of male and female followed by embryological development. Salient features of various phyla are described in Chapter 4. 2.6 VIRUSES, VIROIDS, PRIONS AND LICHENS In the five kingdom classification of Whittaker there is no mention of lichens and some acellular organisms like viruses, viroids and prions. These are briefly introduced here. All of us who have suffered the ill effects of common cold or ‘flu’ know what effects viruses can have on us, even if we do not associate it with our condition. Viruses did not find a place in classification since they are not considered truly ‘living’, if we understand living as those organisms that have a cell structure. The viruses are non-cellular organisms that are characterised by having an inert crystalline structure outside the living cell. 2024-25 20 BIOLOGY Once they infect a cell they take over the machinery of the host cell to replicate themselves, killing the host. Would you call viruses living or non-living? Virus means venom or poisonous fluid. Dmitri Ivanowsky (1892) recognised certain microbes as causal organism of the mosaic disease of tobacco (Figure 2.6a). These were found to be smaller than bacteria because they passed through bacteria-proof filters. M.W. Beijerinek (1898) demonstrated that the extract of the infected plants of  tobacco could cause infection in healthy plants and named the new pathogen “virus” and called the fluid as Contagium vivum fluidum (infectious living fluid). W.M. Stanley (1935) showed that viruses could be crystallised and crystals consist largely of proteins. They are inert outside their specific host cell. Viruses are obligate parasites. In addition to proteins, viruses also contain genetic material, that could be either RNA or DNA. No virus contains both RNA and DNA. A virus is a nucleoprotein and the genetic material is infectious. In general, viruses that infect plants have single stranded RNA and viruses that infect animals have either single or double stranded RNA or double stranded DNA. Bacterial viruses or bacteriophages (viruses that infect the bacteria) are usually double stranded DNA viruses (Figure 2.6b). The protein coat called capsid made of small subunits called capsomeres, protects the nucleic acid. These capsomeres are arranged in helical or polyhedral geometric forms. Viruses cause diseases like  mumps, small pox, herpes and influenza. AIDS in humans is also caused by a virus. In plants, the symptoms can be mosaic formation, leaf rolling and curling, yellowing and vein clearing, dwarfing  and stunted growth.

Linnaeus later classified all living organisms into two kingdoms – Plantae and Animalia. Whittaker proposed an elaborate five kingdom classification – Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia. The main criteria of the five kingdom classification were cell structure, body organisation, mode of nutrition and reproduction, and phylogenetic relationships. In the five kingdom classification, bacteria are included in Kingdom Monera. Bacteria are cosmopolitan in distribution. These organisms show the most extensive metabolic diversity. Bacteria may be autotrophic or heterotrophic in their mode of nutrition. Kingdom Protista includes all single-celled eukaryotes such as Chrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime-moulds and Protozoans. Protists have defined nucleus and other membrane bound organelles. They reproduce both asexually and sexually. Members of Kingdom Fungi show a great diversity in structures and habitat. Most fungi are saprophytic in their mode of nutrition. They show asexual and sexual reproduction. Phycomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes are the four classes under this kingdom. The plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing organisms. Algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms are included in this group. The life cycle of plants exhibit alternation of generations – gametophytic and sporophytic generations. The heterotrophic eukaryotic, multicellular organisms lacking a cell wall are included in the Kingdom Animalia. The mode of nutrition of these organisms is holozoic. They reproduce mostly by the sexual mode. Some acellular organisms like viruses and viroids as well as the lichens are not included in the five kingdom system of classification. Viroids : In 1971, T.O. Diener discovered a new infectious agent that was smaller than viruses and caused potato spindle tuber disease. It was found to be a free RNA; it lacked the protein coat that is found in viruses, hence the name viroid. The RNA of the viroid was of low molecular weight. Prions : In modern medicine certain infectious neurological diseases were found to be transmitted by an agent consisting of abnormally folded protein. The agent was similar in size to viruses. These agents were called prions. The most notable diseases caused by prions are bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) commonly called   mad cow disease in cattle and its analogous variant Cr–Jacob disease (CJD) in humans. Lichens : Lichens are symbiotic associations i.e. mutually useful associations, between algae and fungi. The algal component is known as phycobiont and fungal component as mycobiont, which are autotrophic and heterotrophic, respectively. Algae prepare food for fungi and fungi provide shelter and absorb mineral nutrients and water for its partner. So close is their association that if one saw a lichen in nature one would never imagine that they had two different organisms within them. Lichens are very good pollution indicators – they do not grow in polluted areas. 2024-25 22 BIOLOGY EXERCISES 1.

We have a well developed respiratory system comprising two lungs and associated air passages to perform this function. The first step in respiration is breathing by which atmospheric air is taken in (inspiration) and the alveolar air is released out (expiration). Exchange of O2 and CO2 between deoxygenated blood and alveoli, transport of these gases throughout the body by blood, exchange of O2 and CO2 between the oxygenated blood and tissues and utilisation of O2 by the cells (cellular respiration) are the other steps involved. Inspiration and expiration are carried out by creating pressure gradients between the atmosphere and the alveoli with the help of specialised muscles \\u2013 intercostals and diaphragm. Volumes of air involved in these activities can be estimated with the help of spirometer and are of clinical significance. Exchange of O2 and CO2 at the alveoli and tissues occur by diffusion. Rate of diffusion is dependent on the partial pressure gradients of O2 (pO2) and CO2 (pCO2), their solubility as well as the thickness of the diffusion surface. These factors in our body facilitate diffusion of O2 from the alveoli to the deoxygenated blood as well as from the oxygenated blood to the tissues. The factors are favourable for the diffusion of CO2 in the opposite direction, i.e., from tissues to alveoli. Oxygen is transported mainly as oxyhaemoglobin. In the alveoli where pO2 is higher, O2 gets bound to haemoglobin which is easily dissociated at the tissues where pO2 is low and pCO2 and H+ concentration are high. Nearly 70 per cent of carbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate (HCO3 \\u2013) with the help of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. 20-25 per cent of carbon dioxide is carried by haemoglobin as carbamino-haemoglobin. In the tissues where pCO2 is high, it gets bound to blood whereas in the alveoli where pCO2 is low and pO2 is high, it gets removed from the blood. Respiratory rhythm is maintained by the respiratory centre in the medulla region of brain. A pneumotaxic centre in the pons region of the brain and a chemosensitive area in the medulla can alter respiratory mechanism. Occupational Respiratory Disorders: In certain industries, especially those involving grinding or stone-breaking, so much dust is produced that the defense mechanism of the body cannot fully cope with the situation. Long exposure can give rise to inflammation leading to fibrosis (proliferation of fibrous tissues) and thus causing serious lung damage. Workers in such industries should wear protective masks. 2024-25 192 BIOLOGY EXERCISES 1. Define vital capacity. What is its significance? 2.

Also, the waste or harmful substances produced, have to be removed continuously for healthy functioning of tissues. It is therefore, essential to have efficient mechanisms for the movement of these substances to the cells and from the cells. Different groups of animals have evolved different methods for this transport. Simple organisms like sponges and coelenterates circulate water from their surroundings through their body cavities to facilitate the cells to exchange these substances. More complex organisms use special fluids within their bodies to transport such materials. Blood is the most commonly used body fluid by most of the higher organisms including humans for this purpose. Another body fluid, lymph, also helps in the transport of certain substances. In this chapter, you will learn about the composition and properties of blood and lymph (tissue fluid) and the mechanism of circulation of blood is also explained herein. 15.1 BLOOD Blood is a special connective tissue consisting of a fluid matrix, plasma, and formed elements. 15.1.1 Plasma Plasma is a straw coloured, viscous fluid constituting nearly 55 per cent of the blood. 90-92 per cent of plasma is water and proteins contribute 6-8 per cent of it. Fibrinogen, globulins and albumins are the major proteins. BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION CHAPTER  15 15.1 Blood 15.2 Lymph (Tissue Fluid) 15.3 Circulatory Pathways 15.4 Double Circulation 15.5 Regulation of Cardiac Activity 15.6 Disorders of Circulatory System 2024-25 194 BIOLOGY Fibrinogens are needed for clotting or coagulation of blood. Globulins primarly are involved in defense mechanisms of the body and the albumins help in osmotic balance. Plasma also contains small amounts of minerals like Na+, Ca++, Mg++, HCO3 \\u2013, Cl\\u2013, etc. Glucose, amino acids, lipids, etc., are also present in the plasma as they are always in transit in the body. Factors for coagulation or clotting of blood are also present in the plasma in an inactive form. Plasma without the clotting factors is called serum. 15.1.2 Formed Elements Erythrocytes, leucocytes and platelets are collectively called formed elements (Figure 15.1) and they constitute nearly 45 per cent of the blood. Erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBC) are the most abundant of all the cells in blood. A healthy adult man has, on an average, 5 millions to 5.5 millions of RBCs mm\\u20133 of blood. RBCs are formed in the red bone marrow in the adults. RBCs are devoid of nucleus in most of the mammals and are biconcave in shape. They have a red coloured, iron containing complex protein called haemoglobin, hence the colour and name of these cells. A healthy individual has 12-16 gms of haemoglobin in every 100 ml of blood. These molecules play a significant role in transport of respiratory gases. RBCs have an average life span of 120 days after which they are destroyed in the spleen (graveyard of RBCs). Leucocytes are also known as white blood cells (WBC) as they are colourless due to the lack of haemoglobin. They are nucleated and are relatively lesser in number which averages 6000-8000 mm\\u20133 of blood. Leucocytes are generally short lived. We have two main categories of WBCs \\u2013 granulocytes and agranulocytes. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils are different types of granulocytes, while lymphocytes and monocytes are the agranulocytes. Neutrophils are the most abundant cells (60-65 per cent) of the total WBCs and basophils are the least (0.5-1 per cent) among them. Neutrophils and monocytes (6-8 per cent) are phagocytic cells which destroy foreign organisms entering the body. Basophils secrete histamine, serotonin, heparin, etc., and are involved in inflammatory reactions. Eosinophils (2-3 per cent) resist infections and are also R B C Platelets Eosinophil Basophil Neutrophil Monocyte T lymphocyte B lymphocyte Figure 15.1 Diagrammatic representation of formed elements in blood 2024-25 BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 195 associated with allergic reactions. Lymphocytes (20-25 per cent) are of two major types \\u2013 \\u2018B\\u2019 and \\u2018T\\u2019 forms. Both B and T lymphocytes are responsible for immune responses of the body. Platelets also called thrombocytes, are cell fragments produced from megakaryocytes (special cells in the bone marrow). Blood normally contains 1,500,00-3,500,00 platelets mm\\u20133. Platelets can release a variety of substances most of which are involved in the coagulation or clotting of blood. A reduction in their number can lead to clotting disorders which will lead to excessive loss of blood from the body. 15.1.3 Blood Groups As you know, blood of human beings differ in certain aspects though it appears to be similar. Various types of grouping of blood has been done. Two such groupings \\u2013 the ABO and Rh \\u2013 are widely used all over the world. 15.1.3.1 ABO grouping 15.1.3.1 ABO grouping 15.1.3.1 ABO grouping 15.1.3.1 ABO grouping 15.1.3.1 ABO grouping ABO grouping is based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens (chemicals that can induce immune response) on the RBCs namely A and B. Similarly, the plasma of different individuals contain two natural antibodies (proteins produced in response to antigens). The distribution of antigens and antibodies in the four groups of blood, A, B, AB and O are given in Table 15.1. You probably know that during blood transfusion, any blood cannot be used; the blood of a donor has to be carefully matched with the blood of a recipient before any blood transfusion to avoid severe problems of clumping (destruction of RBC). The donor\\u2019s compatibility is also shown in the Table 15.1. Blood Group Antigens on Antibodies Donor\\u2019s Group RBCs in Plasma A A anti-B A, O B B anti-A B, O AB A, B nil AB, A, B, O O nil anti-A, B O TABLE 15.1  Blood Groups and Donor Compatibility From the above mentioned table it is evident that group \\u2018O\\u2019 blood can be donated to persons with any other blood group and hence \\u2018O\\u2019 group individuals are called \\u2018universal donors\\u2019. Persons with \\u2018AB\\u2019 group can accept blood from persons with AB as well as the other groups of blood. Therefore, such persons are called \\u2018universal recipients\\u2019. 2024-25 196 BIOLOGY 15.1.3.2 15.1.3.2 15.1.3.2 15.1.3.2 15.1.3.2 Rh grouping Rh grouping Rh grouping Rh grouping Rh grouping Another antigen, the Rh antigen similar to one present in Rhesus monkeys (hence Rh), is also observed on the surface of RBCs of majority (nearly 80 per cent) of humans. Such individuals are called Rh positive (Rh+ve) and those in whom this antigen is absent are called Rh negative (Rh-ve). An Rh-ve person, if exposed to Rh+ve blood, will form specific antibodies against the Rh antigens. Therefore, Rh group should also be matched before transfusions. A special case of Rh incompatibility (mismatching) has been observed between the Rh-ve blood of a pregnant mother with Rh+ve blood of the foetus. Rh antigens of the foetus do not get exposed to the Rh-ve blood of the mother in the first pregnancy as the two bloods are well separated by the placenta. However, during the delivery of the first child, there is a possibility of exposure of the maternal blood to small amounts of the Rh+ve blood from the foetus. In such cases, the mother starts preparing antibodies against Rh antigen in her blood. In case of her subsequent pregnancies, the Rh antibodies from the mother (Rh-ve) can leak into the blood of the foetus (Rh+ve) and destroy the foetal RBCs. This could be fatal to the foetus or could cause severe anaemia and jaundice to the baby. This condition is called erythroblastosis foetalis. This can be avoided by administering anti-Rh antibodies to the mother immediately after the delivery of the first child. 15.1.4 Coagulation of Blood You know that when you cut your finger or hurt yourself, your wound does not continue to bleed for a long time; usually the blood stops flowing after sometime. Do you know why? Blood exhibits coagulation or clotting in response to an injury or trauma. This is a mechanism to prevent excessive loss of blood from the body. You would have observed a dark reddish brown scum formed at the site of a cut or an injury over a period of time. It is a clot or coagulam formed mainly of a network of threads called fibrins in which dead and damaged formed elements of blood are trapped. Fibrins are formed by the conversion of inactive fibrinogens in the plasma by the enzyme thrombin. Thrombins, in turn are formed from another inactive substance present in the plasma called prothrombin. An enzyme complex, thrombokinase, is required for the above reaction. This complex is formed by a series of linked enzymic reactions (cascade process) involving a number of factors present in the plasma in an inactive state. An injury or a trauma stimulates the platelets in the blood to release certain factors which activate the mechanism of coagulation. Certain factors released by the tissues at the site of injury also can initiate coagulation. Calcium ions play a very important role in clotting. 2024-25 BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 197 15.2 LYMPH (TISSUE FLUID) As the blood passes through the capillaries  in tissues, some water along with many small water soluble substances move out into the spaces between the cells of tissues leaving the larger proteins and most of the formed elements in the blood vessels. This fluid released out is called the interstitial fluid or tissue fluid. It has the same mineral distribution as that in plasma. Exchange of nutrients, gases, etc., between the blood and the cells always occur through this fluid. An elaborate network of vessels called the lymphatic system collects this fluid and drains it back to the major veins. The fluid present in the lymphatic system is called the lymph. Lymph is a colourless fluid containing specialised lymphocytes which are responsible for the immune responses of the body. Lymph is also an important carrier for nutrients, hormones, etc. Fats are absorbed through lymph in the lacteals present in the intestinal villi. 15.3 CIRCULATORY PATHWAYS The circulatory patterns are of two types \\u2013 open or closed. Open circulatory system is present in arthropods and molluscs in which blood pumped by the heart passes through large vessels into open spaces or body cavities called sinuses. Annelids and chordates have a closed circulatory system in which the blood pumped by the heart is always circulated through a closed network of blood vessels. This pattern is considered to be more advantageous as the flow of fluid can be  more precisely regulated. All vertebrates possess a muscular chambered heart. Fishes have a 2-chambered heart with an atrium and a ventricle. Amphibians and the reptiles (except crocodiles) have a 3-chambered heart with two atria and a single ventricle, whereas crocodiles, birds and mammals possess a 4-chambered heart with two atria and two ventricles. In fishes the heart pumps out deoxygenated blood which is oxygenated by the gills and supplied to the body parts from where deoxygenated blood is returned to the heart (single circulation). In amphibians and reptiles, the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the gills/lungs/skin and the right atrium gets the deoxygenated blood from other body parts. However, they get mixed up in the single ventricle which pumps out mixed blood (incomplete double circulation). In birds and mammals, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood received by the left and right atria respectively passes on to the ventricles of the same sides. The ventricles pump it out without any mixing up, i.e., two separate circulatory pathways are present in these organisms, hence, these animals have double circulation. Let us study the human circulatory system. 2024-25 198 BIOLOGY 15.3.1 Human Circulatory System Human circulatory system, also called the blood vascular system consists of a muscular chambered heart, a network of closed branching blood vessels and blood, the fluid which is circulated. Heart, the mesodermally derived organ, is situated in the thoracic cavity, in between the two lungs, slightly tilted to the left. It has the size of a clenched fist. It is protected by a double walled membranous bag, pericardium, enclosing the pericardial fluid. Our heart has four chambers, two relatively small upper  chambers called atria and two larger lower chambers called ventricles. A thin, muscular wall called the inter- atrial septum separates the right and the left atria, whereas a thick-walled, the inter-ventricular septum, separates the left and the right ventricles (Figure 15.2). The atrium and the ventricle of the same side are also separated by a thick fibrous tissue called the atrio-ventricular septum. However, each of these septa are provided with an opening through which the two chambers of the  same side are connected. The opening between the right atrium and the right ventricle is guarded by a valve formed of three  muscular flaps or cusps, the tricuspid valve, whereas a bicuspid or mitral valve guards the opening between the left atrium and the left ventricle. The openings of the right and the left ventricles into the Figure 15.2 Section of a human heart 2024-25 BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 199 pulmonary artery and the aorta respectively are provided with the semilunar valves. The valves in the heart allows the flow of blood only in one direction, i.e., from the atria to the ventricles and from the ventricles to the pulmonary artery or aorta. These valves prevent any backward flow. The entire heart is made of cardiac muscles. The walls of ventricles are much thicker than that of the atria. A specialised cardiac musculature called the nodal tissue is also distributed in the heart (Figure 15.2). A patch of this tissue is present in the right upper corner of the right atrium called the sino-atrial node (SAN). Another mass of this tissue is seen in the lower left corner of the right atrium close to the atrio-ventricular septum called the atrio-ventricular node (AVN). A bundle of nodal fibres, atrio- ventricular bundle (AV bundle) continues from the AVN which passes through the atrio-ventricular septa to emerge on the top of the inter- ventricular septum and immediately divides into a right and left bundle. These branches give rise to minute fibres throughout the ventricular musculature of the respective sides and are called purkinje fibres. The nodal musculature has the ability to generate action potentials without any external stimuli, i.e., it is autoexcitable. However, the number of action potentials that could be generated in a minute vary at different parts of the nodal system. The SAN can generate the maximum number of action potentials, i.e., 70-75 min\\u20131, and is responsible for initiating and maintaining the rhythmic contractile activity of the heart. Therefore, it is called the pacemaker. Our heart normally beats 70-75 times in a minute (average 72 beats min\\u20131). 15.3.2 Cardiac Cycle How does the heart function? Let us take a look. To begin with, all the four chambers of heart are in a relaxed state, i.e., they are in  joint diastole. As the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are open, blood from the pulmonary veins and vena cava flows into the left and the right ventricle respectively through the left and right atria. The semilunar valves are closed at this stage. The SAN now generates an action potential which stimulates both the atria to undergo a simultaneous contraction \\u2013 the atrial systole. This increases the flow of blood into the ventricles by about 30 per cent. The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by the AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through the entire ventricular musculature. This causes the ventricular muscles to contract,  (ventricular systole), the atria undergoes relaxation (diastole), coinciding with the ventricular systole. Ventricular systole increases the ventricular pressure causing the closure of tricuspid and 2024-25 200 BIOLOGY bicuspid valves due to attempted backflow of blood into the atria. As the ventricular pressure increases further, the semilunar valves guarding the pulmonary artery (right side) and the aorta (left side) are forced open, allowing the blood in the ventricles to flow through these vessels into the circulatory pathways. The ventricles now relax (ventricular diastole) and the ventricular pressure falls causing the closure of semilunar valves which prevents the backflow of blood into the ventricles. As the ventricular pressure declines further, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are pushed open by the pressure in the atria exerted by the blood which was being emptied into them by the veins. The blood now once again moves freely to the ventricles. The ventricles and atria are now again in a relaxed (joint diastole) state, as earlier. Soon the SAN generates a new action potential and the events described above are repeated in that sequence and the process continues. This sequential event in the heart which is cyclically repeated is called the cardiac cycle and it consists of systole and diastole of both the atria and ventricles. As mentioned earlier, the heart beats 72 times  per minute, i.e., that many cardiac cycles are performed per minute. From this it could be deduced that the duration of a cardiac cycle is 0.8 seconds. During a cardiac cycle, each ventricle pumps out approximately 70 mL of blood which is called the stroke volume.\",\n          \"Bond enthalpy  values of some single and multiple bonds are  given in Table 5.3. The reaction enthalpies are  very important quantities as these arise from  the changes that accompany the breaking of  old bonds and formation of the new bonds. We can predict enthalpy of a reaction in gas  phase, if we know different bond enthalpies.

You have learnt about ionization enthalpy  and electron gain enthalpy in Unit 3. In fact, these terms have been taken  from thermodynamics. Earlier terms,  ionization energy and electron affinity  were in practice in place of the above  terms (see the box for justification). Fig. 5.9 \\t Enthalpy diagram for lattice enthalpy of  NaCl 5.

Therefore the solubility of  most salts in water increases with rise of  temperature. If the lattice enthalpy is very  high, the dissolution of the compound may  not take place at all. Why do many fluorides  tend to be less soluble than the corresponding  chlorides? Estimates of the magnitudes of  enthalpy changes may be made by using  tables of bond energies (enthalpies) and lattice  energies (enthalpies). (f)   Enthalpy of Dilution  It is known that enthalpy of solution is the  enthalpy change associated with the addition  of a specified amount of solute to the specified  amount of solvent at a constant temperature  and pressure. This argument can be applied  to any solvent with slight modification. Enthalpy change for dissolving one mole of  gaseous hydrogen chloride in 10 mol of water  can be represented by the following equation. For convenience we will use the symbol aq. for water  HCl(g) + 10 aq. \\u2192 HCl.10 aq. \\u2206H = \\u201369.01 kJ / mol Let us consider the following set of  enthalpy changes: (S-1) HCl(g) + 25 aq. \\u2192 HCl.25 aq. \\u2206H = \\u201372.03 kJ / mol  (S-2) HCl(g) + 40 aq. \\u2192 HCl.40 aq. \\u2206H = \\u201372.79 kJ / mol (S-3) HCl(g) +  \\u221e aq. \\u2192 HCl. \\u221e aq. \\u2206H = \\u201374.85 kJ / mol The values of \\u2206H show general dependence  of the enthalpy of solution on amount of  solvent. As more and more solvent is used,  the enthalpy of solution approaches a limiting  value, i.e, the value in infinitely dilute  solution. For hydrochloric acid this value of  \\u2206H is given above in equation (S-3). cycle. The importance of the cycle is that,  the sum of the enthalpy changes round a  cycle is zero. Applying Hess\\u2019s law, we get, \\u2206latticeH\\uf030 = 411.2 + 108.4 + 121 + 496 \\u2013 348.6 \\u2206latticeH\\uf030 = + 788kJ for NaCl(s) \\uf064 Na+(g) + Cl\\u2013(g) Internal energy is smaller by 2RT (because \\u2206ng  = 2) and is equal to + 783 kJ mol\\u20131. Now we use the value of lattice enthalpy  to calculate enthalpy of solution from the  expression: \\u2206solH\\uf030 = \\u2206latticeH\\uf030 + \\u2206hydH\\uf030  For one mole of NaCl(s),  lattice enthalpy  = + 788 kJ mol\\u20131 and \\u2206hydH \\uf030 = \\u2013 784 kJ mol\\u20131( from the \\t \\t literature) \\u2206sol H\\uf030 = + 788 kJ mol\\u20131 \\u2013 784 kJ mol\\u20131             = + 4 kJ mol\\u20131 The dissolution of NaCl(s) is accompanied  by very little heat change. (e)   Enthalpy of Solution (symbol : \\u2206solH\\uf030 ) Enthalpy of solution of a substance is the  enthalpy change when one mole of it dissolves  in a specified amount of solvent. The enthalpy  of solution at infinite dilution is the enthalpy  change observed on dissolving the substance  in an infinite amount of solvent when the  interactions between the ions (or solute  molecules) are negligible. When an ionic compound dissolves in a  solvent, the ions leave their ordered positions  on the crystal lattice. These are now more free in  solution. But solvation of these ions (hydration  in case solvent is water) also occurs at the  same time. This is shown diagrammatically,  for an ionic compound, AB (s)  2024-25 THERMODYNAMICS\\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t  157 If we subtract the first equation (equation  S-1) from the second equation (equation S-2)  in the above set of equations, we obtain\\u2013  HCl.25 aq. + 15 aq. \\u2192 HCl.40 aq. \\u2206H = [ \\u201372.79 \\u2013 (\\u201372.03)] kJ / mol        = \\u2013 0.76 kJ / mol  This value (\\u20130.76kJ/mol) of \\u2206H is enthalpy  of dilution. It is the heat withdrawn from  the surroundings when additional solvent is  added to the solution. The enthalpy of dilution  of a solution is dependent on the original  concentration of the solution and the amount  of solvent added. 5.6\\t spontaneity The first law of thermodynamics tells us  about the relationship between the heat  absorbed and the work performed on or  by a system. It puts no restrictions on  the direction of heat flow. However, the  flow of heat is unidirectional from higher  temperature to lower temperature. In fact,  all naturally occurring processes whether  chemical or physical will tend to proceed  spontaneously in one direction only. For  example, a gas expanding to fill the available  volume, burning carbon in dioxygen giving  carbon dioxide. But heat will not flow from colder body to  warmer body on its own, the gas in a container  will not spontaneously contract into one  corner or carbon dioxide will not form carbon  and dioxygen spontaneously. These and many  other spontaneously occurring changes show  unidirectional change. We may ask \\u2018what is  the driving force of spontaneously occurring  changes ? What determines the direction of a  spontaneous change ? In this section, we shall  establish some criterion for these processes  whether these will take place or not. Let us first understand what do we mean  by spontaneous reaction or change ? You  may think by your common observation that  spontaneous reaction is one which occurs  immediately when contact is made between  the reactants. Take the case of combination  of hydrogen and oxygen. These gases may  be mixed at room temperature and left for  many years without observing any perceptible  change. Although the reaction is taking place  between them, it is at an extremely slow  rate. It is still called spontaneous reaction. So spontaneity means \\u2018having the potential  to proceed without the assistance of external  agency\\u2019. However, it does not tell about the  rate of the reaction or process. Another aspect  of spontaneous reaction or process, as we see  is that these cannot reverse their direction on  their own. We may summarise it as  follows:  A spontaneous process is an   irreversible process and may only be  reversed by some external agency. (a)  Is Decrease in Enthalpy a Criterion     for Spontaneity ? If we examine the phenomenon like flow of  water down hill or fall of a stone on to the  ground, we find that there is a net decrease  in potential energy in the direction of change. By analogy, we may be tempted to state that  a chemical reaction is spontaneous in a  given direction, because decrease in energy  has taken place, as in the case of exothermic  reactions. For example: 1 2 N2(g) +  H2(g) = NH3(g);                                         \\u2206r H\\u2009 \\uf030 = \\u2013 46.1 kJ mol\\u20131 1 2 H2(g) + 1 2 Cl2(g) = HCl (g);                                     \\u2206r H\\u2009 \\uf030 = \\u2013 92.32 kJ mol\\u20131 H2(g) + 1 2  O2(g) \\u2192 H2O(l) ;                                     \\u2206r H\\u2009 \\uf030 = \\u2013285.8 kJ mol\\u20131 The decrease in enthalpy in passing from  reactants to products may be shown for any  exothermic reaction on an enthalpy diagram  as shown in Fig. 5.10(a). Thus, the postulate that driving force for  a chemical reaction may be due to decrease  in energy sounds \\u2018reasonable\\u2019 as the basis of  evidence so far ! Now let us examine the following reactions: 1 2  N2(g) + O2(g) \\u2192 NO2(g);                                         \\u2206r H\\uf030 = +33.2 kJ mol\\u20131 C(graphite, s) + 2 S(l) \\u2192 CS2(l);                                        \\u2206r H\\uf030 = +128.5 kJ mol\\u20131 2024-25 chemIstry 158 These reactions  though endothermic, are  spontaneous. The increase in enthalpy may  be represented on an enthalpy diagram as  shown in Fig. 5.10(b). Fig. 5.10 (a)\\t Enthalpy diagram for exothermic  reactions Fig. 5.10 (b)\\t Enthalpy diagram for endothermic  reactions Fig. 5.11  Diffusion of two gases respectively and separated by a movable  partition [Fig. 5.11 (a)]. When the partition is  withdrawn [Fig. 5.11(b)], the gases begin to  diffuse into each other and after a period of  time, diffusion will be complete. Let us examine the process. Before  partition, if we were to pick up the gas  molecules from left container, we would be  sure that these will be molecules of gas A  and similarly if we were to pick up the gas  molecules from right container, we would  be sure that these will be molecules of gas  B. But, if we were to pick up molecules from  container when partition is removed, we are  not sure whether the molecules picked are of  gas A or gas B. We say that the system has  become less predictable or more chaotic. We may now formulate another postulate:    in an isolated system, there is always a  tendency for the systems\\u2019 energy to become  more disordered or chaotic and this could be  a criterion for spontaneous change ! At this point, we introduce another  thermodynamic function, entropy denoted  as S. The above mentioned disorder is the  manifestation of entropy. To form a mental  Therefore, it becomes obvious that while  decrease in enthalpy may be a contributory  factor for spontaneity, but it is not true for  all cases. (b) Entropy and Spontaneity Then, what drives the spontaneous process  in a given direction ? Let us examine such a  case in which \\u2206H = 0 i.e., there is no change in  enthalpy, but still the process is spontaneous. Let us consider diffusion of two gases  into each other in a closed container which  is isolated from the surroundings as shown  in Fig. 5.11. The two gases, say, gas A and gas B are  represented by black dots and white dots  2024-25 THERMODYNAMICS\\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t  159 picture, one can think of entropy as a measure  of the degree of randomness or disorder in the  system. The greater the disorder in an isolated  system, the higher is the entropy. As far as a  chemical reaction is concerned, this entropy  change  can be attributed to rearrangement of  atoms or ions from one pattern in the reactants  to another (in the products). If the structure  of the products is very much disordered than  that of the reactants, there will be a resultant  increase in entropy. The change in entropy  accompanying a chemical reaction may be  estimated qualitatively by a consideration of  the structures of the species taking part in the  reaction. Decrease of regularity in structure  would mean increase in entropy. For a given  substance, the crystalline solid state is the  state of lowest entropy (most ordered), The  gaseous state is state of highest entropy. Now let us try to quantify entropy. One way  to calculate the degree of disorder or chaotic  distribution of energy among molecules  would be through statistical method which  is beyond the scope of this treatment. Other  way would be to relate this process to the  heat involved in a process which would make  entropy a thermodynamic concept. Entropy,  like any other thermodynamic property such  as internal energy U and enthalpy H is a state  function and \\u2206S is independent of path. Whenever heat is added to the system,  it increases molecular motions causing  increased randomness in the system. Thus  heat (q) has randomising influence on the  system. Can we then equate \\u2206S with q ? Wait ! Experience suggests us that the distribution  of heat also depends on the temperature at  which heat is added to the system. A system at  higher temperature has greater randomness  in it\\u2009 \\u2009 than one at lower temperature. Thus,  temperature is the measure of average  chaotic motion of particles in the system. Heat added to a system at lower temperature  causes greater randomness than when the  same quantity of heat is added to it at higher  temperature. This suggests that the entropy  change is inversely proportional to the  temperature. \\u2206S is related with q and T for a  reversible reaction as :  \\u2206S = q T rev \\t (5.18) The total entropy change (\\u2206Stotal) for the  system and surroundings of a spontaneous  process is given by \\uf044 \\uf044 \\uf044 S S S total system surr \\uf03d \\uf02b \\uf03e0                    (5.19) When a system is in equilibrium, the  entropy is maximum, and the change in  entropy, \\u2206S = 0. We can say that entropy for a spontaneous  process increases till it reaches maximum  and at equilibrium the change in entropy is  zero. Since entropy is a state property, we can  calculate the change in entropy of a reversible  process by \\u2206Ssys =  qsys rev , T    We find that both for reversible and  irreversible expansion for an ideal gas, under  isothermal conditions, \\u2206U = 0,\\u2009 \\u2009 but \\u2206Stotal    i.e., \\uf044 \\uf044 S S sys surr \\uf02b is not zero for irreversible  process. Thus,\\u2009 \\u2009 \\u2206U does not discriminate  between reversible and irreversible process,  whereas \\u2206S does. Problem 5.10 Predict in which of the following, entropy  increases/decreases : (i)\\t A liquid crystallizes into a solid.

Inspite of negative entropy  change of this reaction, why is the  reaction spontaneous? (\\u2206rH\\uf030  for  this  reaction  is    \\u20131648 \\u00d7 103 J mol\\u20131) Solution One decides the spontaneity of a  reaction by considering \\uf044 \\uf044 \\uf044 S S S total sys surr \\uf02b \\uf028 \\uf029. For calculating  \\u2206Ssurr, we have to consider the heat  absorbed by the surroundings which  is equal to \\u2013 \\u2206rH\\u2009 \\uf030.

(c)\\t Gibbs Energy and Spontaneity We have seen that for a system, it is the  total entropy change, \\u2206Stotal which decides  the spontaneity of the process. But most of  the chemical reactions fall into the category  of either closed systems or open systems. Therefore, for most of the chemical reactions  there are changes in both enthalpy and  entropy. It is clear from the discussion in  previous sections that neither decrease in  enthalpy nor increase in entropy alone can  determine the direction of spontaneous  change for these systems. For this purpose, we define a new  thermodynamic function the Gibbs energy  or Gibbs function, G, as  G = H \\u2013 TS                                      (5.20) Gibbs function, G is an extensive property  and a state function. The change in Gibbs energy for the  system, \\u2206Gsys can be written as \\uf044 \\uf044 \\uf044 \\uf044 G H T S S T sys sys sys sys = \\uf02d \\uf02d At constant temperature,  \\uf05c \\uf02d \\uf044 \\uf044 \\uf044 G H T S sys sys sys =   Usually the subscript \\u2018system\\u2019 is dropped  and we simply write this equation as   \\uf044 \\uf044 \\uf044 G H T S \\uf03d \\uf02d                                  (5.21) Thus, Gibbs energy change = enthalpy  change \\u2013 temperature \\u00d7 entropy change, and  is referred to as the Gibbs equation, one of  the most important equations in chemistry. Here, we have considered both terms together  for spontaneity: energy (in terms of \\u2206H)  and entropy (\\u2206S, a measure of disorder) as  indicated earlier. Dimensionally if we analyse,  we find that \\u2206G has units of energy because,  both \\u2206H and the T\\u2206S are energy terms, since  T\\u2206S = (K) (J/K) = J. Now let us consider how \\u2206G is related to  reaction spontaneity. 2024-25 THERMODYNAMICS\\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t  161 We know,  \\u2206Stotal = \\u2206Ssys +  \\u2206Ssurr \\t   If the system is in thermal equilibrium with  the surrounding, then the temperature of the  surrounding is same as that of the system. Also, increase in enthalpy of the surrounding  is equal to decrease in the enthalpy of the  system. Therefore, entropy change of surroundings,  \\uf044 \\uf044 \\uf044 Ssurr = H T H T surr sys \\uf03d\\uf02d \\uf044 \\uf044 \\uf044 S S total sys \\uf03d \\uf02b\\uf02d \\uf0e6 \\uf0e8 \\uf0e7 \\uf0f6 \\uf0f8 \\uf0f7 H T sys Rearranging the above equation: T\\u2206Stotal  =\\t T\\u2206Ssys \\u2013 \\u2206Hsys For spontaneous process, \\uf044Stotal \\uf03e0 , so               T\\u2206Ssys \\u2013 \\u2206Hsys > \\u039f \\uf0de\\uf02d \\uf02d \\uf028 \\uf029\\uf03e \\uf044 \\uf044 H T S sys sys 0 Using equation 5.21, the above equation can  be written as \\u2013\\u2206G > O \\uf044 \\uf044 \\uf044 G H T S \\uf03d \\uf02d \\uf03c0                                   (5.22) \\u2206Hsys is the enthalpy change of a reaction,  T\\u2206Ssys is the energy which is not available to do  useful work. So \\u2206G is the net energy available  to do useful work and is thus a measure of the  \\u2018free energy\\u2019. For this reason, it is also known  as the free energy of the reaction. \\u2206G gives a criteria for spontaneity at  constant pressure and temperature. (i)\\t If \\u2206G is negative (< 0), the process is  spontaneous. (ii)\\t If \\u2206G is positive (> 0), the process is non  spontaneous. Note : If a reaction has a positive enthalpy  change and positive entropy change, it can  be spontaneous when T\\u2206S is large enough to  outweigh \\u2206H. This can happen in two ways;    (a) The positive entropy change of the system  can be \\u2018small\\u2019 in which case T must be  large. (b) The positive entropy change of the  system can be \\u2018large\\u2019, in which case T may  be small. The former is one of the reasons  why reactions are often carried out at high  temperature. Table 5.4 summarises the effect  of temperature on spontaneity of reactions. (d)\\t Entropy and Second Law of  Thermodynamics We know that for an isolated system  the change in energy remains constant. Therefore, increase in entropy in such  systems is the natural direction of a  spontaneous change. This, in fact is the  second law of thermodynamics. Like first  law of thermodynamics, second law can also  be stated in several ways. The second law of  thermodynamics explains why spontaneous  exothermic reactions are so common. In exothermic reactions heat released  by the reaction increases the disorder  of the surroundings and overall entropy  change is positive which makes the reaction  spontaneous. (e)\\t Absolute Entropy and Third Law of  Thermodynamics  Molecules of a substance may move in a  straight line in any direction, they may  spin like a top and the bonds in the  molecules may stretch and compress. These motions of the molecule are called  translational, rotational and vibrational  motion respectively. When temperature of  the system rises, these motions become  more vigorous and entropy increases. On the  other hand when temperature is lowered, the  entropy decreases. The entropy of any pure  crystalline substance approaches zero as  the temperature approaches absolute zero. This is called third law of thermodynamics. This is so because there is perfect order in  a crystal at absolute zero. The statement is  confined to pure crystalline solids because  theoretical arguments and practical evidences  have shown that entropy of solutions and  super cooled liquids is not zero at 0 K. The  importance of the third law lies in the fact that  it permits the calculation of absolute values  of entropy of pure substance from thermal  data alone. For a pure substance, this can  2024-25 chemIstry 162 Table 5.4  Effect of Temperature on Spontaneity of Reactions \\u2206rH\\uf030\\t \\u2206rS\\uf030\\t      \\u2206rG\\uf030\\t Description* \\u2013\\t +\\t \\u2013\\t Reaction spontaneous at all temperatures \\u2013\\t \\u2013\\t \\u2013 (at low T )\\t Reaction spontaneous at low temperature \\u2013\\t \\u2013\\t + (at high T )\\t Reaction nonspontaneous at high temperature +\\t +\\t + (at low T )\\t Reaction nonspontaneous at low temperature +\\t +\\t \\u2013 (at high T )\\t Reaction spontaneous at high temperature +\\t \\u2013\\t + (at all T )\\t Reaction nonspontaneous at all temperatures *\\t The term low temperature and high temperature are relative.

Standard entropies can be used  to calculate standard entropy changes by a  Hess\\u2019s law type of calculation. 5.7\\t Gibbs energy change and  equilibrium We have seen how a knowledge of the sign  and magnitude of the free energy change of a  chemical reaction allows: (i)\\t Prediction of the spontaneity of the  chemical reaction. (ii)\\t Prediction of the useful work that could  be extracted from it. So far we have considered free energy  changes in irreversible reactions. Let us now  examine the free energy changes in reversible  reactions. \\u2018Reversible\\u2019 under strict thermodynamic  sense is a special way of carrying out  a process such that system is at all  times in perfect equilibrium with its  surroundings. When applied to a chemical  reaction, the term \\u2018reversible\\u2019 indicates  that a given reaction can proceed in either  direction simultaneously, so that a dynamic  equilibrium is set up. This means that the  reactions in both the directions should  proceed with a decrease in free energy, which  seems impossible. It is possible only if at  equilibrium the free energy of the system  is minimum. If it is not, the system would  spontaneously change to configuration of  lower free energy. So, the criterion for equilibrium  A + B \\uf06c C + D;   is \\u2206rG = 0 Gibbs energy for a reaction in which all  reactants and products are in standard state,    \\u2206rG \\uf030 is related to the equilibrium constant of  the reaction as follows:              0  =  \\u2206rG \\uf030 + RT ln K or     \\u2206rG \\uf030  =  \\u2013 RT ln K or     \\u2206rG \\uf030   =  \\u2013 2.303 RT log K                     (5.23) We also know that  \\t      (5.24) For strongly endothermic reactions, the  value of \\u2206rH\\uf030 may be large and positive. In  such a case, value of K will be much smaller    than 1 and the reaction is unlikely to  form much product. In case of exothermic  reactions, \\u2206rH\\uf030 is large and negative, and \\u2206rG\\uf030  is likely to be large and negative too. In such  cases, K will be much larger than 1. We may  expect strongly exothermic reactions to have a  large K, and hence can go to near completion. \\u2206rG\\uf030 also depends upon \\u2206rS\\uf030, if the changes  in the entropy of reaction is also taken into  account, the value of K or extent of chemical  reaction will also be affected, depending upon  whether \\u2206rS\\uf030 is positive or negative.\",\n          \"The formulation of Bohr model involves electrical force between positively charged nucleus and electron. It does not include the electrical forces between electrons which necessarily appear in multi-electron atoms. (ii) While the Bohr\\u2019s model correctly predicts the frequencies of the light emitted by hydrogenic atoms, the model is unable to explain the relative intensities of the frequencies in the spectrum. In emission spectrum of hydrogen, some of the visible frequencies have weak intensity, others strong. Why? Experimental observations depict that some transitions are more favoured than others. Bohr\\u2019s model is unable to account for the intensity variations. Bohr\\u2019s model presents an elegant picture of an atom and cannot be generalised to complex atoms. For complex atoms we have to use a new and radical theory based on Quantum Mechanics, which provides a more complete picture of the atomic structure. * Hydrogenic atoms are the atoms consisting of a nucleus with positive charge +Ze and a single electron, where Z is the proton number. Examples are hydrogen atom, singly ionised helium, doubly ionised lithium, and so forth. In these atoms more complex electron-electron interactions are nonexistent. 2024-25 303 Atoms SUMMARY 1. Atom, as a whole, is electrically neutral and therefore contains equal amount of positive and negative charges. 2. In Thomson\\u2019s model, an atom is a spherical cloud of positive charges with electrons embedded in it. 3. In Rutherford\\u2019s model, most of the mass of the atom and all its positive charge are concentrated in a tiny nucleus (typically one by ten thousand the size of an atom), and the electrons revolve around it. 4. Rutherford nuclear model has two main difficulties in explaining the structure of atom: (a) It predicts that atoms are unstable because the accelerated electrons revolving around the nucleus must spiral into the nucleus. This contradicts the stability of matter. (b) It cannot explain the characteristic line spectra of atoms of different elements. 5. Atoms of most of the elements are stable and emit characteristic spectrum. The spectrum consists of a set of isolated parallel lines termed as line spectrum. It provides useful information about the atomic structure. 6. To explain the line spectra emitted by atoms, as well as the stability of atoms, Niel\\u2019s Bohr proposed a model for hydrogenic (single elctron) atoms. He introduced three postulates and laid the foundations of quantum mechanics: (a) In a hydrogen atom, an electron revolves in certain stable orbits (called stationary orbits) without the emission of radiant energy. (b) The stationary orbits are those for which the angular momentum is some integral multiple of h/2p. (Bohr\\u2019s quantisation condition.) That is L = nh/2p, where n is an integer called the principal quantum number. (c) The third postulate states that an electron might make a transition from one of its specified non-radiating orbits to another of lower energy. When it does so, a photon is emitted having energy equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states. The frequency (n) of the emitted photon is then given by hn  = Ei \\u2013 Ef An atom absorbs radiation of the same frequency the atom emits, in which case the electron is transferred to an orbit with a higher value of n. Ei + hn  =  Ef 7. As a result of the quantisation condition of angular momentum, the electron orbits the nucleus at only specific radii. For a hydrogen atom it is given by r n m h e n = \\uf8eb \\uf8ed \\uf8ec \\uf8f6 \\uf8f8 \\uf8f7 \\uf8eb \\uf8ed \\uf8ec \\uf8f6 \\uf8f8 \\uf8f7 2 2 0 2 2 4 \\u03c0 \\u03c0\\u03b5 The total energy is also quantised: 4 2 2 2 0 8 n me E n h \\u03b5 = \\u2212      = \\u201313.6 eV/n2 The n = 1 state is called ground state. In hydrogen atom the ground state energy is  \\u201313.6 eV. Higher values of n correspond to excited states (n > 1). Atoms are excited to these higher states by collisions with other atoms or electrons or by absorption of a photon of right frequency. 2024-25 Physics 304 8. de Broglie\\u2019s hypothesis that electrons have a wavelength l = h/mv gave an explanation for Bohr\\u2019s quantised orbits by bringing in the wave- particle duality. The orbits correspond to circular standing waves in which the circumference of the orbit equals a whole number of wavelengths. 9. Bohr\\u2019s model is applicable only to hydrogenic (single electron) atoms. It cannot be extended to even two electron atoms such as helium. This model is also unable to explain for the relative intensities of the frequencies emitted even by hydrogenic atoms. POINTS TO PONDER 1. Both the Thomson\\u2019s as well as the Rutherford\\u2019s models constitute an unstable system. Thomson\\u2019s model is unstable electrostatically, while Rutherford\\u2019s model is unstable because of electromagnetic radiation of orbiting electrons. 2. What made Bohr quantise angular momentum (second postulate) and not some other quantity? Note, h has dimensions of angular momentum, and for circular orbits, angular momentum is a very relevant quantity. The second postulate is then so natural! 3. The orbital picture in Bohr\\u2019s model of the hydrogen atom was inconsistent with the uncertainty principle. It was replaced by modern quantum mechanics in which Bohr\\u2019s orbits are regions where the electron may be found with large probability. 4. Unlike the situation in the solar system, where planet-planet gravitational forces are very small as compared to the gravitational force of the sun on each planet (because the mass of the sun is so much greater than the mass of any of the planets), the electron-electron electric force interaction is comparable in magnitude to the electron- nucleus electrical force, because the charges and distances are of the same order of magnitude. This is the reason why the Bohr\\u2019s model with its planet-like electron is not applicable to many electron atoms. 5. Bohr laid the foundation of the quantum theory by postulating specific orbits in which electrons do not radiate. Bohr\\u2019s model include only one quantum number n. The new theory called quantum mechanics supportes Bohr\\u2019s postulate. However in quantum mechanics (more generally accepted), a given energy level may not correspond to just one quantum state. For example, a state is characterised by four quantum numbers (n, l, m, and s), but for a pure Coulomb potential (as in hydrogen atom) the energy depends only on n. 6. In Bohr model, contrary to ordinary classical expectation, the frequency of revolution of an electron in its orbit is not connected to the frequency of spectral line. The later is the difference between two orbital energies divided by h. For transitions between large quantum numbers (n to n \\u2013 1, n very large), however, the two coincide as expected. 7. Bohr\\u2019s semiclassical model based on some aspects of classical physics and some aspects of modern physics also does not provide a true picture of the simplest hydrogenic atoms. The true picture is quantum mechanical affair which differs from Bohr model in a number of fundamental ways. But then if the Bohr model is not strictly correct, why do we bother about it? The reasons which make Bohr\\u2019s model still useful are: 2024-25 305 Atoms (i) The model is based on just three postulates but accounts for almost all the general features of the hydrogen spectrum. (ii) The model incorporates many of the concepts we have learnt in classical physics. (iii) The model demonstrates how a theoretical physicist occasionally must quite literally ignore certain problems of approach in hopes of being able to make some predictions. If the predictions of the theory or model agree with experiment, a theoretician then must somehow hope to explain away or rationalise the problems that were ignored along the way.

The overall dimensions of a nucleus are much smaller than those of an atom. Experiments on scattering of a-particles demonstrated that the radius of a nucleus was smaller than the radius of an atom by a factor of about 104. This means the volume of a nucleus is about 10\\u201312 times the volume of the atom. In other words, an atom is almost empty. If an atom is enlarged to the size of a classroom, the nucleus would be of the size of pinhead. Nevertheless, the nucleus contains most (more than 99.9%) of the mass of an atom. Does the nucleus have a structure, just as the atom does? If so, what are the constituents of the nucleus? How are these held together? In this chapter, we shall look for answers to such questions. We shall discuss various properties of nuclei such as their size, mass and stability, and also associated nuclear phenomena such as radioactivity, fission and fusion. 13.2  ATOMIC MASSES AND COMPOSITION OF NUCLEUS The mass of an atom is very small, compared to a kilogram;  for example, the mass of a carbon atom, 12C, is 1.992647 \\u00d7 10\\u201326 kg. Kilogram is not a very convenient unit to measure such small quantities. Therefore, a Chapter Thirteen NUCLEI 2024-25 307 Nuclei different mass unit is used for expressing atomic masses. This unit is the atomic mass unit (u), defined as 1/12th of the mass of the carbon (12C) atom. According to this definition 12  mass of one  C atom 1u =  12       26 1.992647 10 kg 12 \\u2212 \\u00d7 =       27 1.660539 10 kg \\u2212 = \\u00d7 (13.1) The atomic masses of various elements expressed in atomic mass unit (u) are close to being integral multiples of the mass of a hydrogen atom. There are, however, many striking exceptions to this rule. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine atom is 35.46 u. Accurate measurement of atomic masses is carried out with a mass spectrometer, The measurement of atomic masses reveals the existence of different types of atoms of the same element, which exhibit the same chemical properties, but differ in mass. Such atomic species of the same element differing in mass are called isotopes. (In Greek, isotope means the same place, i.e. they occur in the same place in the periodic table of elements.) It was found that practically every element consists of a mixture of several isotopes. The relative abundance of different isotopes differs from element to element. Chlorine, for example, has two isotopes having masses 34.98 u and 36.98 u, which are nearly integral multiples of the mass of a hydrogen atom. The relative abundances of these isotopes are 75.4 and 24.6 per cent, respectively. Thus, the average mass of a chlorine atom is obtained by the weighted average of the masses of the two isotopes,  which works out to be = 75.4 34.98 24.6 36.98 100 \\u00d7 + \\u00d7 =  35.47 u which agrees with the atomic mass of chlorine. Even the lightest element, hydrogen has three isotopes having masses 1.0078 u, 2.0141 u, and 3.0160 u. The nucleus of the lightest atom of hydrogen, which has a relative abundance of 99.985%, is called the proton. The mass of a proton is 27 1.00727 u 1.67262 10 kg p m \\u2212 = = \\u00d7 (13.2) This is equal to the mass of the hydrogen atom (= 1.00783u), minus the mass of a single electron (me = 0.00055 u). The other two isotopes of hydrogen are called deuterium and tritium. Tritium nuclei, being unstable, do not occur naturally and are produced artificially in laboratories. The positive charge in the nucleus is that of the protons. A proton carries one unit of fundamental charge and is stable. It was earlier thought that the nucleus may contain electrons, but this was ruled out later using arguments based on quantum theory. All the electrons of an atom are outside the nucleus. We know that the number of these electrons outside the nucleus of the atom is Z, the atomic number. The total charge of the 2024-25 Physics 308 atomic electrons is thus (\\u2013Ze), and since the atom is neutral, the charge of the nucleus is (+Ze). The number of protons in the nucleus of the atom is, therefore, exactly Z, the atomic number. Discovery of Neutron Since the nuclei of deuterium and tritium are isotopes of hydrogen, they must contain only one proton each. But the masses of the nuclei of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium are in the ratio of 1:2:3. Therefore, the nuclei of deuterium and tritium must contain,  in addition to a proton, some neutral matter. The amount of neutral matter present in the nuclei of these isotopes, expressed in units of mass of a proton, is approximately equal to one and two, respectively. This fact indicates that the nuclei of atoms contain, in addition to protons, neutral matter in multiples of a basic unit. This hypothesis was verified in 1932 by James Chadwick who observed emission of neutral radiation when beryllium nuclei were bombarded with alpha-particles (a-particles are helium nuclei, to be discussed in a later section). It was found that this neutral radiation could knock out protons from light nuclei such as those of helium, carbon and nitrogen. The only neutral radiation known at that time was photons (electromagnetic radiation). Application of the principles of conservation of energy and momentum showed that if the neutral radiation consisted of photons, the energy of photons would have to be much higher than is available from the bombardment of beryllium nuclei with a-particles. The clue to this puzzle, which Chadwick satisfactorily solved, was to assume that the neutral radiation consists of a new type of neutral particles called neutrons. From conservation of energy and momentum, he was able to determine the mass of new particle \\u2018as very nearly the same as mass of proton\\u2019. The mass of a neutron is now known to a high degree of accuracy. It is m n = 1.00866 u = 1.6749\\u00d710\\u201327 kg (13.3) Chadwick was awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the neutron. A free neutron, unlike a free proton, is unstable. It decays into a proton, an electron and a antineutrino (another elementary particle), and has a mean life of about 1000s. It is, however, stable inside the nucleus. The composition of a nucleus can now be described using the following terms and symbols: Z - atomic number = number of protons [13.4(a)] N - neutron number = number of neutrons [13.4(b)] A - mass number = Z + N                               = total number of protons and neutrons [13.4(c)] One also uses the term nucleon for a proton or a neutron. Thus the number of nucleons in an atom is its mass number A. Nuclear species or nuclides are shown by the notation X A Z  where X is the chemical symbol of the species. For example, the nucleus of gold is denoted by 197 79 Au . It contains 197 nucleons, of which 79 are protons and the rest118 are neutrons. 2024-25 309 Nuclei The composition of isotopes of an element can now be readily explained. The nuclei of isotopes of a given element contain the same number of protons, but differ from each other in their number of neutrons. Deuterium, 2 1 H, which is an isotope of hydrogen, contains one proton and one neutron. Its other isotope tritium, 3 1 H, contains one proton and two neutrons. The element gold has 32 isotopes, ranging from A =173 to A = 204. We have already mentioned that chemical properties of elements depend on their electronic structure. As the atoms of isotopes have identical electronic structure they have identical chemical behaviour and are placed in the same location in the periodic table. All nuclides with same mass number A are called isobars. For example, the nuclides 3 1 H  and 3 2He  are isobars. Nuclides with same neutron number N but different atomic number Z, for example 198 80 Hg and 197 79 Au , are called isotones. 13.3  SIZE OF THE NUCLEUS As we have seen in Chapter 12, Rutherford was the pioneer who postulated and established the existence of the atomic nucleus. At Rutherford\\u2019s suggestion, Geiger and Marsden performed their classic experiment: on the scattering of a-particles from thin gold foils. Their experiments revealed that the distance of closest approach to a gold nucleus of an a-particle of kinetic energy 5.5 MeV is about 4.0 \\u00d7 10\\u201314 m. The scattering of a-particle by the gold sheet could be understood by Rutherford by assuming that the coulomb repulsive force was solely responsible for scattering. Since the positive charge is confined to the nucleus, the actual size of the nucleus has to be less than 4.0 \\u00d7 10\\u201314 m. If we use a-particles of higher energies than 5.5 MeV, the distance of closest approach to the gold nucleus will be smaller and at some point the scattering will begin to be affected by the short range nuclear forces, and differ from Rutherford\\u2019s calculations. Rutherford\\u2019s calculations are based on pure coulomb repulsion between the positive charges of the a- particle and the gold nucleus. From the distance at which deviations set in, nuclear sizes can be inferred. By performing scattering experiments in which fast electrons, instead of a-particles, are projectiles that bombard targets made up of various elements, the sizes of nuclei of various elements have been accurately measured. It has been found that a nucleus of mass number A has a radius R = R 0 A1/3 (13.5) where R0 = 1.2 \\u00d7 10\\u201315 m (=1.2 fm; 1 fm = 10\\u201315 m). This means the volume of the nucleus, which is proportional to R 3 is proportional to A. Thus the density of nucleus is a constant, independent of A,  for all nuclei. Different nuclei are like a drop of liquid of constant density. The density of nuclear matter is approximately 2.3 \\u00d7 1017 kg m\\u20133. This density is very large compared to ordinary matter, say water, which is 103 kg m\\u20133. This is understandable, as we have already seen that most of the atom is empty. Ordinary matter consisting of atoms has a large amount of empty space. 2024-25 Physics 310  EXAMPLE 13.2 Example 13.1 Given the mass of iron nucleus as 55.85u and A=56, find the nuclear density? Solution mFe = 55.85,    u = 9.27 \\u00d7 10\\u201326  kg Nuclear density =  mass volume  =  26 15 3 9.27 10 1 56 (4 /3)(1.2 10 ) \\u2212 \\u2212 \\u00d7 \\u00d7 \\u03c0 \\u00d7  = 2.29 \\u00d7 1017 kg m\\u20133 The density of matter in neutron stars (an astrophysical object) is comparable to this density. This shows that matter in these objects has been compressed to such an extent that they resemble a big nucleus. 13.4  MASS-ENERGY AND NUCLEAR BINDING ENERGY 13.4.1  Mass \\u2013 Energy Einstein showed from his theory of special relativity that it is necessary to treat mass as another form of energy. Before the advent of this theory of special relativity it was presumed  that mass and energy were conserved separately in a reaction. However, Einstein showed that mass is another form of energy and one can convert mass-energy into other forms of energy, say kinetic energy and vice-versa. Einstein gave the famous mass-energy equivalence relation E = mc 2 (13.6) Here the energy equivalent of mass m is related by the above equation and c is the velocity of light in vacuum and is approximately equal to 3\\u00d7108 m s\\u20131. Example 13.2 Calculate the energy equivalent of 1 g of substance. Solution Energy, E = 10\\u20133  \\u00d7 ( 3 \\u00d7 108)2 J      E = 10\\u20133 \\u00d7 9 \\u00d7 1016 = 9 \\u00d7 1013 J Thus, if one gram of matter is converted to energy, there is a release of enormous amount of energy. Experimental verification of the Einstein\\u2019s mass-energy relation has been achieved in the study of nuclear reactions amongst nucleons, nuclei, electrons and other more recently discovered particles. In a reaction the conservation law of energy states that the initial energy and the final energy are equal provided the energy associated with mass is also included. This concept is important in understanding nuclear masses and the interaction of nuclei with one another. They form the subject matter of the next few sections. 13.4.2  Nuclear binding energy In Section 13.2 we have seen that the nucleus is made up of neutrons and protons. Therefore it may be expected that the mass of the nucleus is equal to the total mass of its individual protons and neutrons. However,  EXAMPLE 13.1 2024-25 311 Nuclei  EXAMPLE 13.3 the nuclear mass M is found to be always less than this. For example, let us consider 16 8 O ; a nucleus which has 8 neutrons and 8 protons.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"embedding\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
